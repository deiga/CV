%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

    My role was a Fullstack developer with extensions into operations as I managed their CI environment.
    The backend was based on Java with a custom stack of libraries and the frontend was JavaScript based on jQuery, Bacon.js and Require.js which we started transitioning towards React.js

    \item [Recruitment Platform] I planned and built an Ansible setup to automate launching of new instances of the Platform for new customers into AWS.

    \item [Smartly.io] I was responsible for migrating an old and stale CI system to a modern one, which would be easier to keep up-to-date and would offload work to developer teams.
    The decision was made to work with Jenkins as a platform, but move as much as possible out of the hands of the CI system.
    So all projects were restructured to run tests inside containers and using Jenkins Pipelines all projects had the recipes for how the CI system should handle them.\par
    To all steps of the way, a mentality of configuration-as-code was applied which has allowed the team to create similar CI setups for other needs.
    A big challenge of the transition was Dockerizing previously highly interdependent projects.
    \par
    Additionally, I was heavily involved in automatic and building developer tooling, which allowed developers to reset their development environment to a stable status quo.
